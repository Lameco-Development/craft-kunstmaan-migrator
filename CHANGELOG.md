versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.0-alpha.1 — 2026-07-07

First alpha of the v2 rewrite. The plugin pivots from an all-in-one
extract/transform/load/verify pipeline to a thin, payload-driven **loader**:
it consumes fully-resolved Craft-native JSON payloads and writes them into
Craft. Reading the legacy Kunstmaan database and proposing/compiling
field/section mappings now live entirely in the separate `kuma-migrate`
orchestration repo, which mirrors [`docs/loader-contract.md`](docs/loader-contract.md)
as the payload contract between the two repos.

### BREAKING

- **Plugin handle renamed `kunstmaan-migrator` → `kuma-loader`.** Every
  console command moves from `./craft kunstmaan-migrator/...` to
  `./craft kuma-loader/...`, including the install command
  (`./craft plugin/install kuma-loader`). The composer package name
  (`lameco/craft-kunstmaan-migrator`) and the PSR-4 namespace
  (`lameco\kunstmaanmigrator\`) are unchanged — only the plugin handle and
  human-facing name move.
- **`analyze` / `map` / `compile` / `verify` / `migrate` and the mapping.yaml
  workflow are removed** from this plugin entirely, along with the CP
  "Migration Pipeline" utility, the Anthropic-backed proposal stage, and the
  plugin-owned legacy MySQL connection. That machinery now lives in
  `kuma-migrate`, which reads the legacy database, proposes mappings, and
  compiles them into the JSON payloads this plugin loads. This plugin makes
  no outbound AI calls and never reads a legacy database.
- **Command surface is now exactly five commands:**
  - `kuma-loader/load/entry --payload=<file> [--dry-run]` — validate (and,
    unless `--dry-run`, save) a payload: idempotent upsert by `sourceUid`,
    alias recording, deferred `_ref`s parked for `load/fixup`.
  - `kuma-loader/load/fixup` — second pass, resolves and patches every
    pending `_ref` left behind by `load/entry`.
  - `kuma-loader/load/redirects --payload=<file>` — loads a redirects
    payload, resolving `sourceUid` targets to migrated-entry URIs.
  - `kuma-loader/state/export` — streams the migrator's state table as
    NDJSON for resume/verify tooling.
  - `kuma-loader/doctor` — preflight checks (plugin/state-table reachable,
    storage writable, not production, Retour presence).

### Removed (vs the pre-alpha plan)

- Anthropic-backed `analyze` proposal stage and the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  requirement.
- Single `mapping.yaml` review workflow and its CP editor.
- `compile`, `verify`, `migrate` (and `migrate/install`) console commands.
- Plugin-owned legacy MySQL connection and its `CRAFT_LEGACY_DB_*` /
  `DATABASE_URL` configuration surface — legacy-DB reachability is
  orchestration-side (`kuma-migrate`) now.
- CP "Migration Pipeline" runner utility and CP settings page
  (`hasCpSettings = false`).

### Kept

- **`NeverProductionTrait`** still hard-blocks every write command when
  `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT=production`.
- **Optional SEOmatic / Retour adapters**, runtime-detected via
  `Craft::$app->plugins->getPlugin(...)`; neither is a hard composer
  `require`.
- **PHPUnit 11 test suite** — unit + integration tests, `composer test`.
